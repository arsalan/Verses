# Verses
Verses is an active iOS application that was developed by Pierce Boggan. The inspiration behind the applciation came from a lack of "modern technology" in the way we pray for others, and developed into a larger system to help you store and memorize Bible verses. The entire application is 100% open-source, and was developed using Xamarin.iOS. Some of the key technical features of the app are listed below. Additionally, the **entire** application (and every source file) is documented using the wiki.

## Open-Source
Verses is open-source to exist as an example of a complete and functional Xamarin.iOS app. Also, Verses uses various open source libraries, so I feel that it is only fair that Verses as a whole is open-source. As a college student, another motivation was to allow the community to help with everything from code review to feature selection, to help improve my programming as a whole. 

I suggest you use this application as a reference on creating an iOS application using [Xamarin.iOS](http//www.xamarin.com). The entire application, from features to design choices to actual code documentation is all found on the wiki, and can help provide valuable information for newcomers to the Xamarin platform.
