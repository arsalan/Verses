# Verses
Verses was developed by Pierce Boggan throughout 2012 and into Spring of 2013. The inspiration came from a lack of "technology" in the way we pray for others, and developed into a larger system to help you store and memorize Bible verses as well. 

Important: This application is not really close to done, so don't take anything from this repository as final in any way, shape or form.

## Open-Source
I decided to open-source Verses because of the tremendous help from the community in building this application. Throughout, I've been given plenty of ideas and help from open-source libraries, so I figure it's only fair to release my application as open-source. As a young college student, another motivation was to allow the community to help with everything from code review to feature selection, to help improve my programming as a whole. 

I suggest you use this application as a guiding point on creating an iOS application using [Xamarin.iOS](http//www.xamarin.com). I've filed out a wiki profiling my exact choice in what design choices I made along the process, as well as how the application works piece by piece and as a whole unit. The code is also documented thoroughly, so feel free to surf that for inspiration and/or ideas.

## Features
* Store prayers for later viewing or reminder
* Store Bible verses for later viewing or reminder
* Share prayers with others and let them know you need praying for
* Verse memorization system to help you memorize God's word

### Design Features
* Extensive use of Parse's framework for the login and signup process, as well as the friending system, and push notifications
* Use of SQLite.NET
* Use of LINQ and the async keyword

## Tooling
Verses was built using [Xamarin.iOS](http://ios.xamarin.com). The main reasoning behind using Xamarin's tooling was building a native application that I can easily share lots of my C# code across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Windows 8 Phone).*

* Disclaimer: I worked for three months as an Xamarin intern from September 2012 - December 2012.

## Other
I would love to talk with people regarding their iOS application, or future applications that they may be building and want a little direction with. Just send me an email at pierce@pierceboggan.com, and I'm sure I can give some input! :)
