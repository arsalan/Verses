<p>So you want to memorize some Scripture? Fantastic! Well you have already taken a huge step in downloading Verses, which will serve as a helper for your prayer life, as well as memorizing God's word. One thing that you will notice about Verses is that it isn't entirely complex. There isn't a huge feature set. That is the beauty of Verses. The design team focused on creating a product that is visually stunning and easy to use, so you can focus on memorizing Scripture instead of memorizing how to use the app. Have fun!</p>

<h1 id="prayers">Prayers</h1>

<p>One of the main components of Verses is the prayer functionality. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 tells us to "pray continually". At least for me, this is a daily struggle. However, with the prayer tab, you can store prayers for later viewing. This is not only great for the occasional recited prayer, but also for short, simple things or ideas as well. </p>

<h2 id="accessing">Accessing</h2>

<p>Prayers can be found on the far-left tab of the main screen. This is a listing of all of the prayers you have entered into Verses, along with additional prayers that we thought you might like to have.</p>

<h2 id="creating">Creating</h2>

<p>You can create a new prayer by clicking the "Compose" button in the top-righthand corner of the Prayers tab. Enter a title for the prayer (ex: "Thankful for the Cross"), followed by a comments area, which is where you enter your prayer. We recommend entering a few thoughts here to jog your memory about a particular prayer, be it a joy or a concern. For prayers you would like to have memorized, you may want to enter the prayer in full as you intend to say it.</p>

<h2 id="editing">Editing</h2>

<p>Editing a prayer is simple! Scroll to the prayer you wish to edit in the main table for prayers and tap the container for it. Click the button in the upper-righthand corner, and then select "Edit". Feel free to change your prayer to your liking!</p>

<h2 id="deleting">Deleting</h2>

<p>To delete a prayer, follow the same procedure as editing a prayer. When you click the button in the upper-righthand corner, select "Delete". </p>

<h1 id="verses">Verses</h1>

<p>While memorization is always a plus, sometimes just having a collection of verses can be ideal. For instance, while it would be great to have the entire Romans Road memorized, simply having them in Verses could prove useful when you need quick reference. All verses entered here have the possibility to be memorized, but you can turn off that functionality for select verses if you choose. If you wish to memorize a verse, this is the place you start!</p>

<h2 id="accessing">Accessing</h2>

<p>Prayers can be found on the far-left tab of the main screen. This is a listing of all of the prayers you have entered into Verses, along with additional prayers that we thought you might like to have.</p>

<h2 id="adding">Adding</h2>

<p>You can add a verse by clicking the "Compose" button in the top-righthand corner of the Verses tab. The "title" of your verse is actually the verse you would like to add to your collection. Single verses (Genesis 1:1) as well as ranges (Genesis 1:1-2) are accepted! The comments area below can be used for anything. Typically, a particular verse may conjoure up some thoughts that you may want to capture, and this is a great way to do that.</p>

<h2 id="translation">Translation</h2>

<p>Right now, Verses has four available translations for your use: English Standard Version (ESV), King James Version (KJV), The Message (MSG), and New Living Translation (NLT). To edit these, go to the "Translations" option in the Settings dialog and select your preferred translation. All new verses will be downloaded in the currently selected option. Verses already in your collection will not be affected.</p>

<h2 id="editing">Editing</h2>

<p>Scroll to the verse you wish to edit in the main table for verses and tap the container for it. Click the button in the upper-righthand corner, and then select "Edit". You cannot change the text for the verse, nor the title. If you wish to do that, you should follow the process for adding a new verse. The comments area can always be edited.</p>

<h2 id="deleting">Deleting</h2>

<p>To delete a verse, follow the same procedure as editing a verse. When you click the button in the upper-righthand corner, select "Delete". </p>

<h1 id="memorization">Memorization</h1>

<p>The most vital aspect of Verses is the memorization functionality. Psalm 119:11 says "I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you." Another helpful verse is 2 Timothy 3:16-17 which states "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/why-memorize-scripture">John Piper</a> has an excellent blog post on why you may want to memorize God's word. </p>

<p>We recommend you maybe starting off memorizing a verse a day or every other day. Building a daily habit or routine for memorization is key to not falling away from Scripture memorization. While it may not seem like much over short time periods, a verse a day would result in knowing 365 passages from Scripture! Praise God! After you develop the habit, you may want to start adding more verses to each day's memorization workload.</p>

<h2 id="addingaverse">Adding a Verse</h2>

<p>Make sure that the verse you wish to memorize has been added to your collection via the Verses tab. By default, all verses are memorizable, although you can turn this off for particular verses by tapping the "Memorizable" button on the detail screen for each verse. </p>

<h2 id="movingaverse">Moving a Verse</h2>

<p>Navigate to far-right tab on the bottom of your screen. There are lots of buttons with different text, each of which represent verse memorization for a particular day. If you open up "SUN", for example, it will tell you that there are currently no verses to be memorized for the day. To change this, click on the "QUEUE" button, which has all of the verses yet to be memorized or scheduled. Tap on the text for the verse(s) you wish to memorize for a particular day, scroll to the bottom of the table, and click the "Move" button. Move the verse(s) to the day you wish to memorize it. Verses allows you to control the scheduling of verse memorization entirely. Forget about memorization today? Just move it to the next day. No worries!</p>

<h2 id="memorization">Memorization</h2>

<p>When you have added a verse to a particular day, navigate to the day via the buttons in the memorization tab. Select the verses you wish to memorize, and click "Memorize". With your finger, flick up and down to flip the flashcard. Hold down on the screen to hear Siri read the verse out to you. When you have memorized the verse, click the heart in the lower-righthand portion of the screen. To flip to the next card, flick up or down with two fingers. To go back, flick to your right to dismiss the dialog.</p>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>

<p>We recommend reviewing old verses you have memorized at three times per week. This helps you to retain verses you have already memorized. Research has shown that continuously reviewing material over long periods of time increases retention, which you should leverage for your Bible memorization. If you happen to forget a particular verse, just tap the heart again (it should go from red to white), and it will be returned to your queue for future scheduling.</p></body>
